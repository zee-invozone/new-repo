# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - CI/CD Pipeline Practice

## ⚡ Get Started in 5 Minutes

### 1. **Test Your Pipeline Locally**
```bash
# Make sure you're in your repository directory
cd /path/to/your/repo

# Run the local testing script
./scripts/test-pipeline.sh
```

### 2. **Commit and Push to GitHub**
```bash
# Add all files
git add .

# Commit your changes
git commit -m "Add comprehensive CI/CD pipeline setup"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### 3. **Watch Your Pipeline Run**
- Go to your GitHub repository
- Click on the **Actions** tab
- You'll see your pipeline running automatically!

## 🔄 What Happens Next

### **On Push to Main Branch:**
1. ✅ **Build & Test** - Install dependencies, run tests, build project
2. ✅ **Code Quality** - Linting and security checks
3. ✅ **Docker Build** - Create and push Docker image
4. ✅ **Deploy to Production** - Automatic deployment (if configured)

### **On Push to Develop Branch:**
1. ✅ **Build & Test** - Same as above
2. ✅ **Deploy to Staging** - Automatic deployment to staging environment

### **On Pull Request:**
1. ✅ **Build & Test** - Validate changes before merge
2. ✅ **Code Quality** - Ensure code standards

## 🎯 Practice Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Basic Pipeline Testing**
1. Make a small change to `index.js`
2. Commit and push
3. Watch the pipeline run in GitHub Actions
4. Check the results

### **Scenario 2: Test Failure Simulation**
1. Introduce a bug in `index.js` (e.g., change `+` to `-` in add function)
2. Commit and push
3. Watch the pipeline fail
4. Fix the bug and push again
5. See the pipeline pass

### **Scenario 3: Multi-Environment Deployment**
1. Create a `develop` branch: `git checkout -b develop`
2. Make changes and push: `git push origin develop`
3. Watch staging deployment
4. Merge to main: `git checkout main && git merge develop`
5. Watch production deployment

### **Scenario 4: Manual Deployment**
1. Go to GitHub Actions
2. Click on "Advanced CI/CD Pipeline"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Select environment (staging/production)
5. Watch manual deployment

## 🐳 Docker Practice

### **Local Docker Testing**
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t pipeline-practice .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 pipeline-practice

# Check running containers
docker ps

# View logs
docker logs <container-id>

# Stop and remove
docker stop <container-id>
docker rm <container-id>
```

### **Docker Registry (GitHub Container Registry)**
- Your pipeline automatically builds and pushes to `ghcr.io`
- Images are tagged with branch names and commit SHAs
- Access via: `ghcr.io/your-username/your-repo:latest`

## 🔧 Customization Examples

### **Add a New Test**
1. Edit `test/index.test.js`
2. Add new test cases
3. Push and watch pipeline run tests

### **Modify Build Process**
1. Edit `package.json` scripts
2. Update pipeline YAML files
3. Test locally first

### **Add New Environment**
1. Edit `.github/workflows/advanced-pipeline.yml`
2. Add new deployment job
3. Configure environment variables

## 🚨 Common Issues & Solutions

### **Pipeline Not Running**
- Check if `.github/workflows/` directory exists
- Verify YAML syntax (use GitHub's built-in validator)
- Ensure files are committed and pushed

### **Tests Failing**
- Run `npm test` locally first
- Check test file syntax
- Verify all dependencies are installed

### **Docker Build Fails**
- Check Dockerfile syntax
- Ensure all required files exist
- Verify Docker is running locally

### **Deployment Issues**
- Check environment variables in GitHub Secrets
- Verify deployment permissions
- Check target environment status

## 📊 Monitoring Your Pipeline
